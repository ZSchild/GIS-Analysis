<h2>Walking Time to Clinics in Sioux Falls South Dakota</h2>
This project was done to identify communites within Sioux Falls that have low access to healthcare. Walking times were estimated using a network analysis based on clinic locations and public roads within city limits. This analysis was based on moderate-low traffic conditions and may walk times may be higher under heavy traffic conditions.

<h2>Green Space Area and Childhood Obesity</h2>
In this project, I used machine learning models to classify greenspace area into tree or herbaceous from Sentinel-2 imagery for major cities across the United States (Example from NYC below). Classified greenspace was then used to compare relative greenspace areas and types to childhood obesity rates to determine what outdoor greenspaces are correlated to improved/worse childhood obesity rates. <p align="center">
